/**
 * LAB EXERCISE: Wrap `transferFunds` with newly minted `withAsyncAuthorization`.
 *
 * GOAL:
 * Protect the transferFunds tool with async authorization so that a user is required
 * to approve any transfer performed on their behalf by an agent.
 *
 * WHY:
 * This is important for ensuring that sensitive operations are properly authorized by the user,
 * thereby improving security and user experience.
 *
 * DONE (what has ALREADY been done):
 *  âœ” Core `transferFunds` tool.
 *
 * TODO (what you need to implement):
 *  1. Wrap the existing tool with `withAsyncAuthorization`.
 *     - HINT: You will need to import it from the `auth0` directory.
 *     - You will need to provide the required arguments for `withAsyncAuthorization`.
 *
 *     HINT: `transferFunds` should be the result of invoking `withAsyncAuthorization`.
 *     HINT: `bindingMessage` can be a simple string like "Please approve the transfer".
 *     HINT: Refer back to the interface from `withAsyncAuthorization` if you are not sure what arguments to pass.
 *
 *  2. Retrieve an access token using `getCIBACredentials` and add the `accessToken` to the Authorization header as a Bearer token.
 *     - HINT: You will need to import it from `auth0@ai-vercel`.
 *
 * 3. Update the tool description.
 *    - Remove the instructions to always require confirmation and, instead, tell Aiya to NEVER ask for confirmation as a push notification will be sent.
 *    - How will you word it? There's not a wrong answer!
 *
 * 		HINT: AI models respond well to simple, concise, but explicit instructions. This is not your best friend -- just tell it what to do (or NOT do).
 *
 *  4. Transform the wrapper into a higher-order factory that accepts a Vercel datastream `writer`.
 *     - Be sure to pass the `writer` along. Free rides for writers! ðŸš™
 *
 *     HINT: `transferFunds` should now return a function that invokes `withAsyncAuthorization`.
 *     HINT: Refer back to the interface from `withAsyncAuthorization` if you are not sure what arguments to pass.
 *
 * SUCCESS CRITERIA:
 *  - You can ask Aiya to transfer $$$ (i.e. `transfer $50 from checking to savings`)
 *  - The first time, if not enrolled in push notifications, you will be prompted to enroll.
 *  - After approval, the transaction seamlessly resumes (or immediately executes) the original tool logic.
 *  - You should see real-time messaging in the chat informing you of progress.
