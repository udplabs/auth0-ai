# Prepare App Environment

## Objective

1. Verify that a bootstrapped <mark>Regular Web Application</mark> has been created in your Auth0 tenant with the correct configuration details.
2. Successfully clone the project folder from the provided github repository.
3. Install all the project dependencies, generate the database, and successfully start the application *locally*.


## Description

As a recap, an Auth0 tenant was created for you when you initially started the lab. Make sure you can access the tenant and can see the management dashboard. Also important to note, you will have access to this tenant for *30 days*.

In this module, we will be cloning the bAInkâ€™s demo project files from the provided github repo for local development. You will be meeting Aiya shortly!


## Task 1: Verify lab bootstrap
1. If you have not already, from the Launch Pad in the Lab Guide, launch into your Auth0 tenant.
2. From the Auth0 tenant dashboard, click on **Applications**.
3. From the list of Applications, click on **the bAInk** application.
4. From the application settings screen, confirm that the configuration settings match:
    - **Allowed Callback URLs**: ```http://localhost:3000/auth/callback```
    - **Allowed Logout URLs**: ```http://localhost:3000```
    - **Allowed Web Origins**: ```http://localhost:3000/auth/callback```

## Task 2: Clone the Repo
You can clone the repo using the UI or via command line. Need a [refresher](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) on cloning a repo?

### Command Line (easiest)

<br>

> [!CAUTION]
> If you do not have <kbd>git</kbd> installed on your machine, download and install it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

<br>

1. Clone the repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/udplabs/auth0-ai.git
    ```

2. Step into the project folder

    ```bash
    cd auth0-ai
    ```

3. Verify project files are present

    ```bash
    ls
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > If you're on a windows machine and running **PowerShell**, run the following command instead:
    >```powershell
    > dir
    >```

    <br>

***You should see the following files:***

<summary><h4>Alternative Option: <i>Github Desktop</i></h4></summary>

> [!CAUTION]
> If you do not have Github Desktop installed, you will first need to [download and install](https://desktop.github.com/download/) it.

1. Navigate to the [repo](https://github.com/udplabs/auth0-ai).
2. From the main page click on the **<> Code** button.

4. Follow the prompts in GitHub Desktop.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Refer to [GitHub's instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository?tool=desktop) for further details on cloning a repo using GitHub Desktop.

<br>
</details>

## Task 3: Start the app
1. In your terminal or powershell, install the project dependencies using NPM

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2. Once complete, run the following to generate the database:

    ```bash
    npm run db:generate
    ```
3. After the database is generated, start up the application in *development mode*:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    <br>

    > [!NOTE]
    > If application started successfully, you should see the following:
    >
    > ![Running App](./assets/images/Module02/images/image1.png)
    >
    > *If youâ€™re having trouble, please ask for some assistance from a lab attendant.*

<br>

### Open the app

<br>

> [!WARNING]
> The app may take a few seconds (*or minutes*) the first time to boot up as it *compiles*.
>
> This may be the case for *each* page/route the first time it loads. Please be patient! Pay attention to the console -- if it says "Compiling", it's *compiling*. ðŸ™„

<br>

1. In a web browser (we ***strongly*** recommend Chrome for this lab), navigate to:

    [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)


If everything is working as expected, Aiya will kick off a conversation with you. Aiya will help guide you through the lab (for the most part) from this point forward.
