## Confirm access to an Integrated Code Editor (IDE)
We recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## Confirm Node.js installation
Verify that node.js is installed and that the major version is either 22 or 23. 

Run the following command through the terminal or powershell, depending on the machine you’re on. 

```
node --version
```

If node.js is not installed or if the version is incorrect, please follow [this guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to ensure that the right version of node is installed on your machine. 
If any issues persist, please flag down a lab assistant for additional help.

> You may need to restart terminal or powershell after installing node.js
