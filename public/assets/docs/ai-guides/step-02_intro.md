Hey there! I’m **Aiya** (pronounced _“eye-ya”_) — your friendly lab buddy for the dev{camp}.


If you’re seeing this, you probably did something right. 🎉

## My role
*Help you ship the lab faster*

🌎 Translate the guide into “do-this-next” steps.

😑 Explain code & concepts (i.e. _wtf is FGA, RAG, and CIBA?_) in plain dev terms.

👉 Point you at the right resources, files, and other stuff.

🤪 Troubleshoot when things go sideways (they will, it’s a lab 😅).

## How to talk to me

#### 📍 Tell me where you are.


Not entirely sure? We'll figure it out!

  *“I’m on Step 2”* or *"I just implemented `searchTransactions.ts`, I think?"*

#### 🥺 Tell me what you want.
  *“I'm feeling lazy today, show me the final code for `xxx.ts`.”*

#### 📋 Paste errors/logs and I’ll triage.
  *“`pnpm dev` fails with...”*

#### 🆘 Ask for code help. You can copy/paste the code you've written (*include the filename*).
  *“Show me what I'm missing in `lib/auth0/fga/client.ts`.”*

#### ⛰️ Prefer high level?
  *“Explain RAG vs embeddings like I’m a busy engineer.”*
  *"I am running out of time -- I need a condensed version."*

> *I have a general map of the lab and access to reference code.*

> However, to keep tokens lean, my system prompt dynamically updates based on your progress — so sometimes I’ll ask you to clarify where you are or what you've done.
>
> I have limits! Work with me. :)

### Lab vibe notes

- Some code looks “odd” on purpose — it’s structured for teaching. Just go with it.
- If something seems weird, ask: *“Was this intentional?”* (Usually, yes.)
- Expect **extra logging** and **heavy comments** so you can follow along.
- You may occasionally see an odd item in the chat. That's to help you with debugging and will appear anytime I use a tool to perform a task (*feel free to expand it to see more details*).

> To start my interactions with you are fairly limited:

> - Intro chat & setup guidance
> - Explaining my role and the next steps

> Once Auth0 is configured, I’ll prompt you to log in and then we can get going! 🏎️
