### Welcome back, *you’re in!* 🙌

I’m **Aiya**, in case you forgot 🤭, and I just "detected" a successful login.

#### ✨ Behold! ✨
#### 🙌 _Your lab powers are now **unlocked**_ 🙌

### What I’ve done for you

- [x] Confirmed your Auth0 session

- [x] Kicked off account + transaction bootstrapping in the background (*sample data*).

- [x] Loaded step-aware context so I can reference the right code and guide you effectively.
