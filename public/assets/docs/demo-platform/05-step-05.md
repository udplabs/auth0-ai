#### Expected Outcome
*In this section we will expand the existing code found in* <kbd>lib/auth0/fga/client.ts</kbd> to enable a fully functioning <abbr title='Fine-Grained Authorization'>FGA</abbr> client.

*Normally*, if you are following [the SDK instructions](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/install-sdk), you would need to add the OpenFGA package. *However, you already did* when you first ran <kbd>pnpm install</kbd>.

##### STEP 0
- [x] ~~Install <kbd>@openfga/sdk</kbd>~~

Awesome, right? Let's keep moving.


#### Open `lib/auth0/fga/client.ts`.

You will notice some of the code has *already been written* for you, but there is a lot missing! Let's quickly review what you'll need to do:

##### STEP 1
- [x] ~~*Define a (mutable) module‚Äëlevel singleton reference*.~~ _<span style='color: green; font-variant: small-caps'>‚Üê Done for you</span>_

##### STEP 2
- [ ] *Create (internal) FGA client.*
- You will need to pull in the <kbd>.env</kbd> variables you setup previously and initialize a *new* instance of `OpenFgaClient`.
- You will need, at a minimum, the following options:
  ```ts
  {
    apiUrl: process.env.FGA_API_URL,
    storeId: '',
    credentials: {
      method: CredentialsMethod.ClientCredentials,
      config: {
        apiTokenIssuer: '',
        apiAudience: '',
        clientId: '',
        clientSecret: ''
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  > Closed the dialog? Not sure how to get back? üò´
  >
  > ***Check out the [FGA Docs](https://docs.fga.dev/integration/setup-sdk-client) for guidance** (or ask Aiya!)*.

  <br>

##### STEP 3
- [x] ~~*Export a public getter*~~. _<span style='color: green; font-variant: small-caps'>‚Üê Done for you</span>_

---

You should now see <kbd>Success! FGA client initialized</kbd> in the console. If so, then great job! üëè üéâ üåÆ

If not... check in with Aiya (*or a lab attendant*) to see where things may have gone awry.

You *may* need to **refresh the app**.

<br>

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Seeing an error like the following?
>
> ![FGA Error](./assets/images/fga-client-error.png)
>
> That just means you need to keep moving forward in the lab to finish implementing <abbr title='Fine-Grained Authorization'>FGA</abbr>.
>
> *Onward!*

<br>

## Add <kbd>getAccountPermissions</kbd> Tool
*Now we are going to move on to* `lib/auth0/fga/get-account-permissions.ts`.

#### Expected Outcomes
In this file you will complete the code necessary to:

1. actually call <abbr title='Fine-Grained Authorization'>FGA</abbr>;
2. check what the user is permitted to do;
3. adjust the API response based on the permissions <abbr title='Fine-Grained Authorization'>FGA</abbr> returned.

##### STEP 1
- [x] ~~*Guard for non-initialized client*.~~ _<span style='color: green; font-variant: small-caps'>‚Üê Done for you</span>_

##### STEP 2
- [ ] *Define the relations to check for*.
  ```typescript
  [
   "can_view",
   "can_view_balances",
   "can_view_transactions",
   "can_transfer"
  ]
  ```

  <br>

  > [!TIP]
  > If you want to see how things work in the client, try leaving one or two permissions out and see what happens!
  >

  <br>

##### STEP 3
- [ ] *Build the <abbr title='Fine-Grained Authorization'>FGA</abbr> batch checks*.
- In this step you will build an array of checks to send to <abbr title='Fine-Grained Authorization'>FGA</abbr> *in batch*.
- Think of it as asking <abbr title='Fine-Grained Authorization'>FGA</abbr> <kbd>Does user:\<customerId> have \<relation> on account:\<id></kbd>? *You just need to ask in a way <abbr title='Fine-Grained Authorization'>FGA</abbr> understands!*

##### STEP 4
- [x] ~~*Make a batch request to FGA via the client SDK*.~~ _<span style='color: green; font-variant: small-caps'>‚Üê Done for you</span>_

  <br>

  > [!TIP]
  > Use typescript errors to your advantage! You should be getting one here that will provide a hint on how to complete the previous step.

  <br>

##### STEP 5
- [x] ~~*Build/collect allowed relations per account id*.~~ _<span style='color: green; font-variant: small-caps'>‚Üê Done for you</span>_
- This step is simply parsing the response into a usable array we can reference to build the account response.

##### STEP 6
- [ ] *Build the final accounts response*

  Don't overthink this one! It seems complicated but it is simple:
1. *What permissions did <abbr title='Fine-Grained Authorization'>FGA</abbr> return for this account?*
2. *How should the response be modified, if at all, to adjust for what <abbr title='Fine-Grained Authorization'>FGA</abbr> returned?*
3. *Return the account data.*

##### STEP 7
- [x] ~~*Return the modified response*.~~ _<span style='color: green; font-variant: small-caps'>‚Üê Done for you</span>_

<br>

---
> [!TIP]
> In addition to asking Aiya for your account information you can also click on `Accounts` in the sidebar to do things _the old fashion way_. üôÑ
>
> ![Sidebar Account Menu](./assets/images/sidebar-accounts.png)
---

<br>

## Pulse Check
*Have you been able to successfully fetch account data?* üò¨

#### _That's ok!_ Everything is working *exactly how it should be -- you should not be seeing accounts.*


***We need tuples!***

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> Not sure what '*tuples*' are? Check out Auth0's [FGA documentation](https://docs.fga.dev/fga-concepts#what-is-a-relationship-tuple) *or ask Aiya.*

<br>

In the lab, we are simulating ***non-real-world situations***. *Normally* when an account is *initially created* (*or permissions modified in other ways*) the permissions would be set as tuples in <abbr title='Fine-Grained Authorization'>FGA</abbr>.

***Because your account data was auto-generated, you don't have any permissions!***

But don't worry, to save time, we've created a shortcut for you.

1. Open the 'dev tools' menu (*right-side of app*) and click on **Reset Account Permissions*.

![Reset Permissions](./assets/images/dev-tools-reset-permissions.png)

ü•Å ***drum roll please...*** ü•Å üéâ Accounts! üéâ

<sup>(*you might need to refresh the page*)</sup>

<br>

> [!TIP]
> If you are successfully seeing account information, but it is not *complete* (*see the following image*) then you *may not be checking for permissions correctly*.

> At least you get to preview what it looks like when <kbd>can_view_balances</kbd> is not granted! :D

## Recap

### In this step you:
- [x] Installed and initialized the OpenFGA (Auth0 <abbr title='Fine-Grained Authorization'>FGA</abbr>) client.
- [x] Implemented permission retrieval (`getAccountPermissions`) to check: <kbd>can_view</kbd>, <kbd>can_view_balances</kbd>, <kbd>can_view_transactions</kbd>, <kbd>can_transfer</kbd>.
  - [x] Attached those permissions to the account API response so both the UI and Aiya can respect them.
- [x] Seeded relationship tuples via the Dev Tools shortcut (Reset Account Permissions).
- [x] Verified behavior when specific permissions are missing (e.g. balances or transactions hidden).
- [x] Confirmed that no data is returned until valid tuples exist (_secure by default_).

### Quick self‚Äëcheck:
- Do you see account rows after seeding tuples?
- Does hiding one permission (e.g. omit <kbd>can_view_balances</kbd>) remove only that portion of the UI / AI response?
- Does Aiya refrain from *hallucinating* missing data?

### Key takeaway
- Fine-Grained Authorization sits *directly* in the <abbr title='Retrieval-Augmented Generation'>RAG</abbr> layer.
- Retrieval of account data is itself ‚ÄúRAG,‚Äù even though no vector database was involved.
- You grounded the AI (*and UI*) in only what the user is permitted to view -- no leaking data!

### Next up
You‚Äôll build on these permissions to enforce more nuanced capabilities (e.g. transfers, transaction visibility) and now have the know-how to apply the same pattern to *other* retrieval tools -- let your imagination run wild!

### Proceed when:
‚úÖ <abbr title='Fine-Grained Authorization'>FGA</abbr> client logs ‚ÄúSuccess‚Äù

‚úÖ Accounts appear after reset

‚úÖ Permission toggles behave as expected

*If any item is failing, revisit:*
- Environment variables
- Client initialization
- The specific <abbr title='Fine-Grained Authorization'>FGA</abbr> check calls you implemented
- Tuple seeding

<br>

> [!TIP]
> Don't forget, you can always ask Aiya for help!

<br>

### *Onward to the next step!*
