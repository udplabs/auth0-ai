Now it’s time to wire up authentication so your app can actually log people in. Until this step is complete, AIya is running in “training wheels” mode. Once you’re logged in, the fun (RAG + FGA) really begins. 🚀

## ✅ Expected Outcome

By the end of this step you should:

- Be able to sign up / log in via Auth0.
- Have a working session in your app.
- Trigger AIya’s “you’re authenticated!” message.
- Unlock the rest of the lab steps.

## Update `.env` (server-side variables)

Open the **root** of your project and locate the `.env` file. Add the following:

```bash
# Auth0 tenant domain (*without* https://)
AUTH0_DOMAIN={{idp.tenantDomain}}

# Client ID for your lab app
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID={{TheBAInk.credentials.clientId}}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Where do I find these values?**
>
> If the values are not pre-populated above, follow the these steps:
> 1. Navigate to the [Auth0 Demo Platform Dashboard](https://manage.cic-demo-platform.auth0app.com/dashboard).
> 2. Select your tenant (the one created for this lab -- you probably already have it open!).
> 3. Go to **Applications → Applications → \[the bAInk]**.
> 4. Copy the **Domain** and **Client ID**.

---

## Update `.env.local` (server-side + secrets)

Next, open `.env.local` (create it if missing). Add:

```bash
# The application’s client secret (from Auth0 app settings)
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET={{TheBAInk.credentials.clientSecret}}

# A session secret (generate one yourself!)
# openssl rand -base64 32
AUTH0_SECRET=<randomly-generated-value>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 👉 **Where do I find these values?**
>
> * `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`: From the same **Applications → \[Lab App]** screen
> * `AUTH0_SECRET`: Generate using OpenSSL (or your favorite random generator):
>
> ```bash
>  openssl rand -base64 32
>  ```

> [!WARNING]
> Never commit `.env.local` to git. It belongs *on your machine only*.

## Save & Restart

Just to be safe, restart your dev server so it picks up the new environment variables:

1. Terminate the app:
<br>`^` + `C` (Mac)
<br> *or*
<br>`Ctrl` + `C` (PC)

2. Start it again:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Test authentication

1. Open the app at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).
2. Click **Sign up**.
3. Create a user (use an email you can access).
4. Pick a password. I know... passwords are so last year. *That's another lab for another day*.

If everything is working:

* You’ll be redirected back to the app as an authenticated user.
* A message will be sent (automatically) to AIya that you have *successfully authenticated*.
* From here, accounts + transactions are automatically created for you behind the scenes. 🎉
  * Feel free to click on **Accounts** if you don't believe me!

If it doesn’t work:

* Check your `.env` and `.env.local` for typos.
* Open the browser console and/or server logs for error details.
* Ask AIya -- e.g. `I’m failing auth with error XYZ` (*and paste the error message*).
