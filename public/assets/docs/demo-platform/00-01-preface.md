### FGA, RAG, & CIBA... oh my!

This guide attempts to mirror the Google codelab style: short steps, runnable code, and clear outcomes.

You’ll build a **Bank Zero** demo app (Next.js / App Router) that showcases **Auth0 Auth for AI** as well as **Auth0 FGA** (fine‑grained authorization) powering **RAG** and **securing AI tools**. Your companion assistant **AIya** is available inside the app to keep you moving.

# Just a few things...

- This lab uses a combination of the Okta Demo Platform and a self-guided learning application. Feel free to switch between the two but keep in mind the content _may_ vary slightly. When in doubt, the Demo Platform is [most likely] the more accurate source of truth.

- Throughout the lab you will see types of alerts/panels like the following. They provide useful information. Take a minute to familiarize yourself with their intent so you know which ones you should _really_ pay attention to. :)
