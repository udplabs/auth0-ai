### Summary
## Welcome to Auth0 dev{camp} | Agentic AI
The bAInk, a respected local bank that has served its community for over 20 years, recently green-lit plans to modernize their existing consumer facing products and services. The bank worked with third party consultants to bring to life online banking services via a web portal and mobile application. These projects were met with great success and the bank saw a major uptick in service adoption and funds deposited into their institution.

As a result, the bank executives began looking further to modernize their platforms. This eventually pivoted to include AI with hopes to accelerate the growth of their platforms. As a result, this initiative gave life to Aiya, the companion AI assistant created to streamline navigation of online banking services like balance transfers, account management, and online bill payments.

As newly minted The bAInk contract developers for the next 2 hours, we will dive into the implementation of Aiya through the lens of Auth0â€™s Auth for AI Agents suite of features.
