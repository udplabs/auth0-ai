Now that the repo has been cloned, go ahead and open it in your IDE.

When ready, run the following in your console.
```bash
pnpm install
```

> [!NOTE]
> `pnpm` is pretty fast, but it might take a few minutes -- the network might be getting hammered!

Once complete, go ahead and run:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

This should startup the app.

If you are seeing the following, you're ready to head to the next step!

If you're not... you might need to ask for assistance.

## Open the app

Congrats! You have spun up a basic chat app. Easy, right? ðŸ¤£

You should now be able to open up a web browser (we recommend Chrome) and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

> [!TIP]
> You can also simply press **âŒ˜** + click the link in the terminal.
>
> On a PC? ðŸ¤¨ You know the drill... ***CTRL*** + click.

If everything is working as expected, AIya will kick off a conversation with you. AIya will help guide you through the lab (*for the most part*) from this point forward.
