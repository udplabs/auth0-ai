## Activate Auth0 Tenant

An Auth0 tenant has been created for you. In the top right corner of your screen, click the **Accept Invitation** button, or follow the activation instructions in the email you received from `no-reply@demo.okta.com` to the email address with which you registered.

Click on **Accept Invitation** and follow the steps. This will launch you into the Auth0 management dashboard.

You now have an Auth0 tenant for providing identity services for your applications. You will have access to this tenant for **30 days**.

### Verify lab bootstrap

* **Application**: a *Regular Web App* named `the bAInk` should have been created.
<!-- * **MFA (SMS)**: the tenant is configured to use `https://sms.atko.rocks` for the SMS gateway. -->

> [!TIP]
> If something is missing, don’t panic — AIya can help you manually "re‑bootstrap" from inside the app.
>
> Or ask a lab attendant for assistance.
