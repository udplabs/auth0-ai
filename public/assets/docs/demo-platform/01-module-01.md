## Objective

In the previous section we already verified you have access to your Auth0 tenant. Now let's make sure your local environment meets all of the requirements that are laid out in the prerequisites section of this module.

#### *It is important that the requirements are met in order for your participation in the lab to be successful.*

## Prerequisites

You must have the following:
 - **System requirements**
    - **64-bit** Windows, Mac, or Linux Laptop with Internet
    - at least **8GB** memory
    - Disabled VPN
 - **Local development environment**
    - Node.js v22.0 or v23.0
    - Integrated Code Editor (VS Code recommended)
    - Auth0 Guardian mobile app


## Verify system requirements
1. On your mac, windows, or linux machine, verify that it is **64-bit**.
2. On your device, ensure that the internet connection is stable.
3. If you are typically on a VPN, *please disable the VPN for this lab.*


## Confirm Access to Auth0 Tenant

If you have not already opened your Auth0 tenant (or if you closed it), from the Launch Pad in the Lab Guide, launch into your Auth0 tenant. You will be using this throughout the lab so we advise you keep a tab open.

> *If any issues continue to persist with accessing the Auth0 tenant, please flag down one of the lab assistants to troubleshoot.*

## Confirm access to an Integrated Code Editor (IDE)
We recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). But we realize there are numerous options available.

This lab uses *TypeScript* so andy IDE that offers some form of Intellisense will greatly improve your learning experience.

## Confirm Node.js installation
Verify that node.js is installed and that the major version is either 22 or 23.

Via your terminal/console/PowerShell of choice, run the following command:

```bash
node --version
```

If node.js is **not** installed, or if the version is incorrect, please follow Node's [guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to ensure that the right version of node.js is installed on your machine.

If any issues persist, please flag down a lab assistant for additional help.


> [!Warning]
>
> You will need to restart terminal or powershell after installing node.js.
>
> *(or reloading your config)*


## Confirm Auth0 Guardian download
Make sure to download the Auth0 Guardian app on your mobile device

| App Store                                    | Google Play                                    |
